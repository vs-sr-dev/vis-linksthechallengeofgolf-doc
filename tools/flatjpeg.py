"""flatjpeg.py -- the control-population method, moved from palettes to JPEG.

`flatness.py` was written last session for a 1992 Tandy VIS disc and its file
handling does not apply here. Its **method** does, and the method is the part
worth carrying: find a population on the object whose nature is already known,
measure the statistic on that, then score the unknown against the range the
control occupies. The statistic itself is imported from `flatness.py` so that
this is literally the same code and not a re-implementation that happens to
agree.

On this object the control is sitting in the open. The `Desktop Wallpapers`
directory holds seven images at up to six resolutions each: they are digital
artwork exported from a drawing program, they carry no scanner resolution, and
their JPEG marker sequence says Photoshop "Save for Web". The `Concept Art`
directory is the unknown, and its filenames make a claim -- "as scribbled on by
Steve Purcell", "with notes from the artist" -- that a filename is not entitled
to settle.

The statistic is the fraction of 2 x 2 pixel blocks whose four samples are
equal, measured on the luma channel. Paper grain, pencil tooth and scanner
noise destroy it; flat digital fills produce it.

TWO THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS DISHONEST, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT THEM

  * **JPEG itself flattens.** A heavily compressed image scores higher than a
    lightly compressed one regardless of origin, so the tool prints bytes per
    pixel beside the statistic and the reader can see whether the two
    populations were compressed alike.
  * **Downscaling flattens too.** The wallpapers exist at six sizes and the
    small ones are resampled, so the control range is printed per resolution
    as well as pooled.
