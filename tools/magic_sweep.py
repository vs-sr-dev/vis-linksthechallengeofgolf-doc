"""Sweep the whole partition for every container tag the corpus knows.

Three families of needle:

  * **the corpus's own** -- the envelopes and project tags of the twelve
    *Tales* builds documented so far, plus the middleware stamps that turned up
    beside them, plus the two names -- `stan` and `dimlos` -- that *Tales of
    the Tempest* raised and *Tales of Innocence* did not settle;
  * **the direct prequel's** -- what the 2003 GameCube release of this game
    carries, read out of that repository rather than invented: `MSCF`, `top2`,
    `Top2Btl`, `_custom`, `rutee`, `tod2_cut`, `h4m`, `HVQM4`;
  * **the middleware** anyone might have bought instead.

**Read the chance rate before reading any count.**  A four-byte needle turns
up by chance about once per 4 GB of uniform data.  The reading of a count
therefore changes with the size of the medium and the count alone does not say
so:

    Tales of Innocence, 128 MB cartridge      0.031 expected hits
    Tales of Hearts, 256 MiB cartridge        0.063 expected hits
    Ratatosk no Kishi, 4.29 GB Wii partition  1.00  expected hits
    Tales of Vesperia, 7.84 GB XGD2 image     1.82  expected hits

On the two discs a single hit means nothing and a zero is weak.  On a
cartridge the rate is small enough that **a single hit is worth locating and a
zero is strong** -- the denominator points the ordinary way round, which after
two disc-sized targets is worth saying out loud.  The table prints the
expected rate beside every needle so the two kinds are never mixed.

Longer needles are worth much more here, and the table prints the expected
rate for each so the two kinds are never mixed.
