"""checkscore.py -- count the verdicts in docs/24 out of the tables.

The header of the scoring document has been wrong twice: 46/16/29/9 and then
42/18/31/8, both tallied by hand while the sections were still being edited.
This counts them out of the tables instead, so the header can be checked
against the body with a command rather than by adding up again.

Two things the counter has to know:

  * the row "| P04-P08 | unresolved | ... |" stands for five clauses, not one;
  * the analogy table in P96 has the same leading "| Pnn |" shape but its
    second column is "content" or "method", not a verdict, so those rows are
    excluded and reported separately.

  * P93 is scored in the tools chapter, not here, and is counted as deferred.
