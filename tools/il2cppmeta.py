"""Read the string tables out of an il2cpp `global-metadata.dat`.

This file is the only English on DISSIDIA's data directory outside fifty-six
table names: 25,070,416 bytes holding every C# class, method, field and
namespace name in the managed code, and every string literal the code contains.
It holds no code -- that is in `libil2cpp.so`, which this pipeline does not
disassemble -- so what comes out is an index, not a program.

THE HEADER IS NOT THE PUBLISHED ONE, AND THE FILE SAYS SO ITSELF.

Every public description of this format calls the header an array of
`(offset, size)` **pairs**.  Read that way, DISSIDIA's file gives a third
section starting at 31,022 when the second ends at 124,468, which is not a
layout, it is noise.  Read as **triples** -- offset, size, and a third field --
the sections chain end to end:

    section 0   offset        380  size    124,088   third  31,022
    section 1   offset    124,468  size  1,070,745   third  31,021
    section 2   offset  1,195,216  size  3,262,785   third 176,874
    ...
    section 30                                    ends at 25,070,416

**and 25,070,416 is the length of the file, residue 0** -- 31 sections, each
starting where the last ended give or take at most four bytes of alignment.
That is the check this reader is built on: it is a quantity the file states
twice, it fires on the whole header rather than on a sample, and no wrong
layout satisfies it.  Version 39 accompanies Unity 6000.3.10f1 here; whether it
is a stock Unity layout or a fork is not settled by this tool, and the tool does
not claim it.

The two sections that matter are found by content, not by position: the
identifier table is the largest NUL-terminated ASCII run, and the literal data
is the other one.  `strings` prints them; `grep` searches them; `census` counts.
