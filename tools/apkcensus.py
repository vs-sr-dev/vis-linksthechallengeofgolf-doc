"""The blind decode census for an Android package: every byte, both dialects,
with the container tree walked rather than assumed.

Section 7 of tales-blockcodec-doc gives two rules that shape this file.
**Sweep per member, not per image** -- `plausible()` bounds a candidate by
whether its declared stream fits inside the buffer it sits in, which rejects
nearly everything for free inside a small file and almost nothing inside a
hundred-megabyte one, so a whole-file sweep is both slower and weaker.  And
**a tool written for a tree that is not this one fails silently in the
direction of a clean negative**, so every level has to be named.

Why `census.py` from the PlayStation 3 pipeline was not adapted
--------------------------------------------------------------
It knows `TLZC`, Bink, `CPK `, `CRILAYLA`, `FPS4`, the nine-byte block, `SPKD`,
`U8` and Sofdec packs.  **Not one of those levels exists in this package**, and
neither do `SLZ` or `ISF`, the two the other Android title in this corpus uses.
Running it here would report a build with 1,096 flat payloads and no descent,
and the zero at the bottom would look like a measurement.  This file is that
tool re-aimed: same rules, same reporting, the levels this platform actually
has.

What it descends through
------------------------
  1. **the zip** -- 1,096 entries.  A stored entry is swept as it lies; a
     deflated one is inflated first, because a decoder cannot be expected to
     find a block through deflate and because the plaintext is what the
     program sees.
  2. **ELF** -- each `PT_LOAD` segment separately, so that a scan of a 73 MB
     library is a scan of the parts the loader maps rather than of one buffer.
  3. **Unity SerializedFile** -- every object body separately, which is what
     makes the plausibility bound do any work: 9,761 objects rather than 465
     files.  A `.splitN` set is joined first.
  4. **FSB5** -- every sample separately.
  5. **dex** -- swept whole; this tool does not read the dex structure.

What it does NOT descend through, stated rather than left to inference:
  * `global-metadata.dat`, because it is encrypted and there is nothing to
    descend into -- it is swept as it lies and counted;
  * `libengine.so`, which is not an ELF file at all;
  * the encrypted tails of `libil2cpp.so` and `libstub.so`, which are inside
    the file and therefore swept, but are not code and are marked as such;
  * `resources.arsc`, the compiled resource table, swept whole;
  * anything else whose format is not one of the five above.

Every count of those is printed as `undescended`, because a payload a reader
did not open is a payload it did not test.

    This is the denominator the bare hit count needs, and it is also the reason
    the full sweep is slow on this package.  `plausible()` accepts an offset
    whose method byte is one of the five, whose two declared sizes are sane and
    ordered, and whose stream fits the buffer -- and then `unpack()` runs the
    decoder over it.  On ordinary data almost nothing passes.  On the two
    encrypted `libil2cpp.so`, where every byte value is equally likely, a
    great many offsets pass and each one costs a decode of up to sixteen
    megabytes.  Section 7 calls this failure mode "a blind sweep can be
    defeated by the data rather than by the buffer", and this package is a
    clear case of it.

    Counting candidates without decoding them is cheap -- about 0.7 seconds
    per mebibyte per dialect -- so it finishes, and "N offsets passed the
    filter and none of them decoded" is a stronger statement than "no hits".
