"""Find the block codec's ring constants in an executable, on four CPUs.

Section 7 of tales-blockcodec-doc gives the shortcut: scan for the immediates
4078 and 4079 (and, since 2004, 4080; and, since the tenth build, 4070 and
4071, which are the bound of a ring clear unrolled by eight).  They are the
packer's constants, not the programmer's, and nothing else in a game has a
reason to load 4,078.  It works in the negative too: an executable with no
4078 anywhere does not contain the decoder.

The shortcut was written for MIPS and extended to PowerPC.  Both are
fixed-width machines with a 16-bit immediate field, so "scan the words" is a
complete search.  **On ARM it is not**, and that is the reason this file
exists:

  * An ARM data-processing immediate is an 8-bit value rotated right by an
    even amount.  **4078 (0xFEE) and 4079 (0xFEF) cannot be encoded at all**
    -- they need nine significant bits.  A compiler emits them as 32-bit words
    in the literal pool, loaded with `ldr rX, [pc, #off]`.
  * **4080 (0xFF0) can** be encoded: 0xFF ror 28.  So the three constants of
    the corpus behave in two different ways on this machine, which is itself a
    datum about what a hit means.
  * 4070 (0xFE6) and 4071 (0xFE7) cannot be encoded either.
  * In THUMB, `mov rd, #imm8` reaches 255 and no further, so every one of
    these constants is a literal-pool word there too.

**On the SPU it is two scans as well, and for a different reason.** The
PlayStation 3 is the first machine in this corpus with two instruction sets in
one executable: a PowerPC PPU, which `--ppc` already handles, and six SPUs
whose ISA is not PowerPC at all.  A decompressor is precisely the kind of work
a PS3 port moves onto an SPU, so a `--ppc` scan that returns zero has covered
one of the two processors.

The SPU is a 32-bit fixed-width machine, so "scan the words" is the right
shape -- but its immediate fields do not all reach:

  * **RI10** -- `ai`, `ahi`, `sfi`, `andi`, `ori`, `xori`, `ceqi`, `cgti`,
    `clgti` -- carries a **signed 10-bit** field, so it reaches -512..511.
    **None of the five constants can be encoded in it.**  A scan that looks
    only there finds nothing on a machine that might well contain them, which
    is the ARM trap in a new key.
  * **RI16** -- `il` (signed 16), `iohl` (unsigned 16) -- reaches all five.
    `ilh` splats its 16 bits into every halfword and `ilhu` into the upper
    half of every word, so a hit there is the constant shifted, not the
    constant; both are decoded and reported with that said.
  * **RI18** -- `ila` -- carries eighteen bits and reaches all five.
  * and **`lqd` / `stqd`** carry a signed 10-bit field **scaled by sixteen**,
    so they reach 4080 and cannot reach 4078, 4079, 4070 or 4071.  That is
    not a curiosity: 4080 is 4078 rounded up to a multiple of sixteen, which
    is exactly the shape the 2004 PlayStation 2 build produced when a
    quadword store was wanted, and the SPU has nothing but quadword stores.

So `--spu` runs an immediate pass over the forms that can hold the value, a
scaled pass over the quadword displacements, and a data pass over every
aligned word of the module -- because a constant the compiler could not
encode reaches an SPU as a word in the module's own local-store image.  All
three denominators are printed.

So the ARM scan is two scans, and both are run and both denominators are
printed:

  1. **immediate fields** -- every ARM data-processing instruction with I=1,
     and every THUMB instruction carrying a literal, decoded and compared;
  2. **literal-pool words** -- every 4-byte-aligned u32 equal to a wanted
     constant, then cross-referenced against every PC-relative load in the
     image to say whether any instruction actually points at it.

A raw word match is weak on its own: a specific 32-bit value turns up by
chance about once per 4 GB of uniform random data, but code is not uniform and
small integers are common.  The cross-reference is what makes a hit mean
something, and the denominator is printed either way, because "zero hits" is
worth nothing without "out of how many words".
