"""mdmd.py -- reader for the `MDmd` container found on the VIS pressing of
*Links: The Challenge of Golf* (Access Software / Tandy, 1992).

There is no public definition of this format. Everything below was measured on
the nine specimens on that disc and every assertion the reader makes is one it
will fail loudly on. Nothing here is inferred from the `.LZ` file extension,
which is a filename and not an algorithm.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND HOW TO RE-MEASURE IT

`MDmd` is not "an archive with a directory". It is a **recursive node format**:
every node, at every depth, begins with the same 122-byte header, and a file is
a *chain* of one or more such nodes laid end to end.

      55     67   build path, space-padded to offset 122
     122      -   payload

    count > 0 : the payload is a DIRECTORY of `count` x 17 bytes -- 13 bytes
                of NUL-padded name, then a u32 LE ABSOLUTE file offset of the
                child node.
    count = 0 : the payload is a FILE of `stored` bytes.

THE BYTE AT +24 IS A COMPRESSION FLAG

    +24 = 0 : the payload is stored VERBATIM, and raw == stored.
    +24 = 1 : the payload is COMPRESSED from `raw` bytes down to `stored`.

Directories are always stored verbatim, so every node with children carries 0
and looks, from outside, like a structural marker. It is not one. **A node with
no children can also carry 0**, and then it is an uncompressed file: the first
version of this reader asserted that +24 = 0 implied a directory, and it
refused `SOUNDW.LZ` at its member `CLAPLOUD.WAV`, which has no children, a
flag of 0, and raw == stored == 38,828. That refusal was the reader working.

The pre-briefing carried into this session read the byte at +24 as a generation
marker, because at the top level of the nine files it is `01` on exactly the
two whose ISO 9660 dates predate the VIS port (1990 and 1991) and `00` on the
seven dated 1992 -- 9 of 9, no exception. **That correlation is real and its
explanation is not.** Every one of `GOLF1.LZ`'s nine children carries `01`, and
they were written on the same day as their parent. The byte says *compressed*,
and the two old files correlate with it only because they are flat chains of
compressed members with no index node on top, while the seven newer files each
open with an index, and an index is never compressed.

THE CHECK THIS FORMAT GIVES AWAY FREE

Child extents are declared twice and must agree. A child's size is
`122 + stored` read from the child's OWN header, and the next child's position
is read from the PARENT's directory. `--validate` requires

    child[i].offset + 122 + child[i].stored == child[i+1].offset

for every i, and requires the last child to end exactly at the end of the
parent, and requires the first child to begin at `parent + 122 + count * 17`.
Residue must be 0. A container that tiles by construction proves nothing; this
one does not tile by construction, because the two numbers come from two
places.

The same applies to a top-level chain: the nodes must cover the file exactly.

THE CODEC, WHICH IS LZW AND WAS NOT GUESSED FROM THE EXTENSION

Compressed payloads are **variable-width LZW, LSB-first**: initial code width
9, first free code 258, code 256 resets the table, code 257 ends the stream,
ceiling 13 bits. See `lzw_decode` for how it was identified, which was by known
plaintext and not by reading `.LZ` as "Lempel-Ziv".

**`--verify` decodes every member and compares its length against the `raw`
field in its own header. It reports 320 of 320.** That is the check worth
having: the packer wrote `raw` and the decoder re-derives it, so a codec that
were merely plausible would not survive 320 firings.

USAGE

    python tools/mdmd.py FILE --validate
    python tools/mdmd.py FILE... --verify
    python tools/mdmd.py FILE --tree
    python tools/mdmd.py FILE... --census
    python tools/mdmd.py FILE --extract OUTDIR [--raw]
    python tools/mdmd.py FILE... --codec
    python tools/mdmd.py FILE --names

`--validate` is meant to be run before `--census`, and it is meant to fail on
anything that is not this format. `LINKS.CFG` (14 bytes), `TITLE.SCR` and
`CONTROL.TAT` are the negative controls that ship with the disc.
`--extract --raw` writes the undecoded streams for anyone auditing the codec.
