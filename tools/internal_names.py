"""Names the assets call themselves, as opposed to names the file system gives.

On *Tales of the Tempest* this harvest produced `stan` and `dimlos`, two names
from a different game in the series, and on *Tales of Innocence* the same
harvest -- taught to descend into the container -- withdrew them.  It is the
cheapest cross-title instrument the corpus has and the one most easily run on
a fraction of the data by accident, so this tool prints its own coverage
first.

What it can and cannot see on this disc:

  * the studio's own index containers keep a directory of
    `u32 offset, u32 size, u16 length, name` records in plain text, so their
    members' names are readable;
  * `bres`, `REFF`, `REFT`, `RSAR` and `RSTM` carry NW4R string tables, also
    plain;
  * **1,506 `MSCF` payloads are compressed in a format this repository has not
    identified, so any name inside one of them is invisible to this harvest.**
    That is 813 MB, 19.9% of the file system, and it is stated here rather
    than left for the reader to infer from a low count.

    python internal_names.py PARTITION.bin
    python internal_names.py PARTITION.bin --grep rutee,stan,dimlos
    python internal_names.py DIR --dir            (a plain extracted tree)
