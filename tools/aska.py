aska.py -- is this tri-Ace's ASKA engine?

Everything else in this repository assumes the answer is yes and reads
Infinite Undiscovery. This one asks the question, of any file: a disc image, a
container, an executable, a loose payload. Point it at something and it reports
which ASKA signatures are present and where.

The point is that the signatures are *arbitrary*. Nothing forced tri-Ace to
reverse a FourCC and staple an ASCII version to it, or to call a compression
wrapper `SLZ`, or to open a navigation mesh with `0x0131F119`. Those are
choices, and a choice repeated in another title is evidence in a way that a
common structure never is.

What it looks for
-----------------
**Versioned magics.** A byte-reversed FourCC then an ASCII version, the
convention the container uses for itself and five payloads use after it. The
version digits are reported rather than required, because a later title is very
likely to have bumped them -- and a bumped version is a more interesting
finding than an exact match, since the difference between two revisions of the
same format tends to explain the fields that a single revision leaves opaque.

**Payload magics.** The `A?F` family -- an A for Aska, a letter for the
content, an F for file, padded to four bytes -- plus `AAC `, which breaks the
naming because it is a container rather than a file.

Two of those five collide with something else and are reported with a
structural check for that reason. `ASF ` is also Microsoft's Advanced Systems
Format, the container WMV ships in, and a disc with video on it has a great
deal of that -- Infinite Undiscovery's first disc carries 630 MB of it in the
container gaps alone. `AAC ` is also the audio codec, which is not what
tri-Ace means by it. Neither collision is a problem once the length field
behind the magic has to make sense as well.

**Structural constants.** The `SLZ` wrapper and its version byte; the
`0x0131F119` that opens an AI node field; the `MRON` entry table shape.

**The art pipeline.** Names the artists typed in Maya that survived onto the
shipped disc: the `R:M:` node prefix, `pColSphere` / `pColCube` / `pColCapsule`,
and `Tri_ace` itself, which is a node in the opening logo scene. These are
weaker evidence about the engine and stronger evidence about the studio, and
they survive changes to the binary formats that the magics would not.

**The shader toolchain.** `AHSL`, which names the shader cache the engine
writes -- `AHSLDiskCacheXe` on the Xbox 360, `AHSLDiskCachePs3_*` shipped as
loose files in the PlayStation 3 build -- and the profile data beside it. It is
listed among the pipeline names rather than above them because four ASCII
letters are four ASCII letters; what makes it worth sweeping for is that it is
the one name so far seen to survive a change of *platform*.

**The engine namespace.** `Aska::` in an executable's RTTI settles the question
outright. Two manglings are looked for, because tri-Ace did not stay on one
compiler: MSVC writes `@Aska@@`, which is what an Xbox 360 XEX carries once
`xex.py` has decrypted it, and the Itanium ABI that Clang and GCC use writes
its namespace length-prefixed, so `Aska` becomes `4Aska` inside `_ZN4Aska...`.
A PlayStation build will be the second kind.

**Endianness.** The ASCII *names* -- the versioned magics, the Maya node
prefixes, the namespace -- match unchanged whatever the byte order. The
**payload magics do not**, which was learned from a specimen rather than
assumed: a FourCC written out as a 32-bit word comes out reversed on a
little-endian build, and Star Ocean: Anamnesis on Android stores `AIF ` as
` FIA`. Those five, the `SLZ` wrapper and the node field constant are all
looked for both ways round. That asymmetry
is worth knowing: **the conclusive tests survive a change of byte order, and
the readers do not.** Finding the magics on a little-endian title would say the
format is the same while every `struct` format string in this repository would
still need flipping to read it.

Reading the result
------------------
The tests are asymmetric, and the summary says so. A hit on the versioned
magics or the namespace is conclusive. **A miss proves very little**: a studio
can change its container while keeping its scene format, and the platform layer
-- texture tiling, audio codec, compression -- is expected to differ on
anything that is not an Xbox 360.
