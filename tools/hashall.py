"""hashall.py -- one line per file: sha1, size, path.

Written because the eighth session published pc-harrypotter4-doc/notes/
sha1-all.txt and that file turned a thirty-second measurement into something
possible without the other disc in the drive. This produces the same artefact
for this disc, in the same shape, so the next session gets the same courtesy.

The path printed is relative to ROOT and uses forward slashes, so two lists
made on two machines compare.
