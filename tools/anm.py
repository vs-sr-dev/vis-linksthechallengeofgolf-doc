"""Open the outer layer of the other engine's animation files.

The Rebel Assault demo on this disc is a second LucasArts engine with formats
that are not SCUMM: `.ANM`, `.CHK`, `.NUT`, `.SAD`, `.BMF`, `.FNT`. This tool
opens exactly one of them, and its job is as much to say *how much is still
closed* as to report what it found.

What the bytes give without any outside knowledge:

* An `.ANM` begins `ANIM` followed by a big-endian length -- the same
  `[tag][BE length]` shape as the SCUMM container two directories away, from
  the same studio in the same year, **with the opposite inclusion rule**. In
  the SCUMM container `LECF` declares 13,789,910 on a file of 13,789,910: the
  length includes the eight header bytes. Here `ANIM` declares 40,496 on a
  file of 40,504, and the first sibling of `AHDR` sits at 8 + 8 + 774 where
  `AHDR` declared 774: the length **excludes** the header. Two chunked
  formats, one building, one year, two conventions -- and the only way to know
  which you are holding is to make the walk close.
* The first child is `AHDR`, 774 payload bytes: a 16-bit version, a 16-bit
  frame count, one more 16-bit field, and then exactly **768** bytes, which is
  a 256-entry RGB palette. 6 + 768 = 774 is the whole of it, with nothing left
  over -- which is the argument that it is a palette, not a hope.
* The rest of the file is a sequence of `FRME` chunks, one per frame.

Everything below the frame chunk -- the actual video codec -- is **not opened**
and this tool says so with a byte count, because an unopened fraction that is
measured is a result and an unopened fraction that is not mentioned is a hole.

Usage:
  python tools/anm.py <file.anm ...>
  python tools/anm.py --census <dir>
