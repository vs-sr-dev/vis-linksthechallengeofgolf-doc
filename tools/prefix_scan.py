"""Longest identical byte run between one routine and a whole executable.

`xarch.py` answers a narrower question than it looks like it does.  It aligns
two routines the caller has already located and reports the longest identical
byte run *between those two windows*.  That is the right test when both
addresses are known and trusted, but it cannot distinguish "the decoder was
recompiled and moved" from "the decoder is not there at all", and it cannot
find a shared prefix that survived into some other routine.

This tool asks the whole-file version.  Take N bytes of A starting at a virtual
address, and find the longest run of those bytes that appears *anywhere* in B,
at any alignment, without being told where to look.  For the corpus's own
control -- Tales of Destiny 1997 against Tales of Eternia 2000 -- the answer is
212 bytes, which is the number tales-blockcodec-doc reports from a completely
different method, so a run of that magnitude is what a shared object looks like.

The search is a rolling hash over B's k-grams with a binary search on k, so it
is linear in the size of B per probe and finishes on a four-megabyte executable
in well under a second.  A match is verified against the actual bytes before it
is reported; the hash is only used to find candidates.

Controls are not optional.  Short runs occur by chance in any two MIPS
routines -- `nop` padding, common `addiu sp, sp, -N` prologues, `jr ra` -- so
every run this prints should be read against `--control`, which repeats the
search with an unrelated routine of the same length as the needle.  On this
corpus the noise floor is six to eight bytes.
