"""Open `SAMNMAX.RSC`, the shell's resource file, and check it closes.

`SAM.EXE` is the menu program: the highway screen that offers the game, the
demos, the sound setup and the four Red Book tracks. Its data is one 745,041
byte file, and the file is not encrypted and not chunked -- it is a directory
of nine entries followed by nine payloads.

The layout, derived by arithmetic and then tested:

    +0   u32 LE   entry count, 9
    then, per entry:
      ...      a byte 0x04 introduces the entry
      11       the name in MS-DOS FCB form, `LECLOGO2FLC`, NUL-terminated
      u16      an index
      7        seven bytes identical in every entry
      u32      a field that varies
      u32      the payload SIZE
      n        the name again in ordinary form, `LECLOGO2.FLC`, NUL-terminated

    then the nine payloads, in directory order, back to back.

The test that fixes it, and the only reason to believe any of the above: the
nine sizes are 469,992 + 14,320 + 11,382 + 11,622 + 72,353 + 70,414 + 46,736
+ 38,625 + 9,172 = **744,616**, the directory ends at byte **425**, and
425 + 744,616 = **745,041**, which is the file. Nothing was fitted to make
that happen; if the size field had been the wrong u32 the sum would have been
nonsense. The tool prints the sum and the residue and refuses to call it
closed unless the residue is zero.

What is in it is the interesting part, and it is why this file has a tool:
`README.TXT` is one of the nine payloads, 9,172 bytes, the same length as the
two loose copies. The disc therefore carries the Italian readme **three**
times -- in the root, in `SAMNMAX/`, and inside this archive -- and only two
of the three are visible to a SHA-1 census of files.
